# Java Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Java console applications developed to practice programming logic, loops, and data structures.  
Each mini project focuses on a specific concept or Java feature.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. Counter Mini Project
A simple counter that increases numbers sequentially.  
- Demonstrates the use of **loops**, **methods**, and **increment logic**.  
- The program allows users to start counting from any number and display the count result.

**Concepts used:**  
`for` / `while` loops, user input (`Scanner`), class and method structure.

---

### 2. Down Counter Mini Project
This project performs the **reverse operation** of the counter.  
It counts **downward** from a given number to zero.  
- Useful to understand **loop control** and **decrement logic**.  
- May include delay effects or printed output for each step.

**Concepts used:**  
Loops (`for`, `while`), conditions, decrementing, method reuse.

### 3. Data Structures
This folder includes implementations of **common data structures** in Java.  
Examples may include:
- `ArrayStack`
- `ArrayQueue`
- `LinkedList`
- `Node` classes  

Each class demonstrates fundamental operations such as `push`, `pop`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and iteration through lists.

**Concepts used:**  
Object-oriented programming (OOP), generics, arrays, and linked lists.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Java SE (8 or higher)
- **IDE:** NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- **Libraries:** Standard Java API only (no external dependencies)
